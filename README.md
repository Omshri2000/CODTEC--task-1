Summary of the project :-
The Password Strength Assessment Tool is a Python-based tool designed to evaluate the strength of user-provided passwords by checking three
key factors: length, complexity, and uniqueness. It uses regular expressions to verify the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters,
digits, and special characters, and compares the password against a list of commonly used passwords. Based on these checks, the tool assigns
a score and categorizes the password as "Strong," "Medium," or "Weak." The tool provides feedback to guide users in creating stronger, more 
secure passwords, ultimately enhancing cybersecurity.
